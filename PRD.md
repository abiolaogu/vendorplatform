# Product Requirements Document: VendorPlatform

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Active Development
**Owner:** BillyRonks Global Limited

---

## Executive Summary

**VendorPlatform** is a contextual commerce orchestration platform that recognizes a fundamental truth: when someone needs one service, they typically need 5-15 related services. We become the orchestration layer that predicts adjacent needs, pre-qualifies vendors, reduces coordination friction, and captures the entire transaction value chain across 15 service clusters.

### Vision Statement
"When life happens, we handle it" - Transform how people discover, coordinate, and manage service vendors across major life events and daily needs.

### Business Objectives
- Capture 10-15% of multi-vendor transaction value chains instead of single 3-5% commissions
- Reduce service discovery friction from 2-3 weeks to 2-3 hours
- Enable vendor ecosystem growth through B2B partnerships and referrals
- Provide emergency response infrastructure with guaranteed SLAs
