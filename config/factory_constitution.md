# 🏭 FACTORY CONSTITUTION: The Holy Trinity & Compliance Standard

**Version:** 2.0 (Enterprise-Grade)
**Target Infrastructure:** Harvester HCI (Bare Metal/VM)

## 1. The Holy Trinity of Development
All software generated by this factory MUST adhere to:
* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**
    * Logic must be isolated in the `Domain` layer.
    * Infrastructure (Databases, APIs) must be in the `Infrastructure` layer.
    * Strict Bounded Contexts must be defined.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    * **Rule:** No code is written without a failing test first.
    * Unit Test coverage must exceed 90%.
* **Extreme Programming (XP):**
    * Small releases, simple design, and continuous integration.

## 2. The Compliance Gauntlet
Every product must pass the "Regulatory Check" for its target sector:
* **Global/Generic:** SOC2 Type II (Audit Logging), ISO 27001 (Access Control).
* **Health (HIPAA):** Encryption at rest/transit, PHI masking.
* **Nigeria (NDPR):** Data sovereignty, explicit consent, user data export.
* **Gov/Enterprise (FedRAMP/GDPR):** FIPS-validated cryptography.

## 3. Architecture Pattern (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)
* **Core:** Entities & Value Objects (Pure logic, no dependencies).
* **Ports:** Interfaces defining how outside world talks to Core.
* **Adapters:** Implementations (SQL, HTTP, Harvester).
